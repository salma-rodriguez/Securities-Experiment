                <p>Here is my <a href="https://salma-rodriguez.github.io/FinEngPrimer/index.html">financial engineering training</a></p>
                <p>This is a financial time series project of my own. I have completed the first two notebooks in Jypter Lab with computer code in Julia, Python and the R statistical programming system.
                <p>Here is my <a href="Treas%20Exploratory%20Analysis.html">Exploratory Analysis</a>, and here is my <a href="Treas%20TS%20Analysis.html">Time Series Analysis</a>. I will be making further updates as I complete my third notebook, which will include a thorough cross-validation and forecasting, VARFIMA models, MCMC testing, heteroscedastic models, fourier analysis and spectral analysis.</p>
