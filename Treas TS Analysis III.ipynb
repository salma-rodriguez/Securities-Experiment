Since Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the returns investors can earn on them are often used as a “risk-free” benchmark in finance research and investment practice. These securities are a promise to repay the principal (with interest if a note or a bond) to the holder (can be a public or private entity). Therefore, the real yield curve rate would be adjusted for inflation in the yield curve."
