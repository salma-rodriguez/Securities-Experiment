    "According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, a [nominal Treasury security](https://www.federalreserve.gov/data/nominal-yield-curve.htm) is an issuance that specifies principal and interest as fixed dollar amounts to the holder. Since Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, the returns investors can earn on them are often used as a “risk-free” benchmark in finance research and investment practice. These securities are a promise to repay the principal (with interest if a note or a bond) to the holder (can be a public or private entity). Therefore, the real yield curve rate would be adjusted for inflation in the yield curve."
